Web app details (1/5)

The application generated by Bubblewrap will open a Progressive Web App when
started from the Android launcher. Please enter the following details about
the PWA:

        - Domain: the domain / origin where the PWA is hosted.
          Example: example.com

        - URL path: an URL path relative to the root of the origin,
          opened when the application is started from the home screen.
          Examples:

                - To open https://example.com/: /
                - To open https://example.com/path-to-pwa/: /path-to-pwa/

? Domain: https://maxtelecomltda.beesweb.com.br
? URL path: /

Android app details (2/5)

Please, enter details regarding how the Android app will look when installed
into a device:

        - Application name: the name used in most places,
          including the App information screen and on the Play Store.

        - Short name: an alternate name for the app, limited to
          12 characters, used on a device launch screen.

        - Application ID: also known as Package Name, this is
          the unique identifier for the application on an Android device or
          the Play Store. The name must contain at least two segments,
          separated by dots, each segment must start with a letter and all
          characters must be alphanumeric or an underscore (_).

        - Display mode: how the app will be displayed on the
          device screen when started. The default mode, used by most apps,
          is standalone. fullscreen causes the device status bar and
          navigation bars to be removed and is suitable for games or media
          players. For more information on the status bars and navigation
          bar on Android, go to:
           - https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-bars.html.

        - Status bar color: sets the status bar color used when the
          application is in foreground. Example: #7CC0FF

? Application name: Max Telecom
? Short name: MaxTelecom
? Application ID: br.com.beesweb.maxtelecomltda
? Starting version code for the new app version: 6
? Display mode: standalone
? Orientation: default
? Status bar color: #FFFFFF

Launcher icons and splash screen (3/5)

The Android app requires an image for the launcher icon. It also displays a
splash screen while the web content is loading, to avoid displaying a flash of
a blank white page to users.

        - Splash screen color: sets the background colour used for the
          splash screen. Example: #7CC0FF

        - Icon URL: URL to an image that is at least 512x512px. Used to
          generate the launcher icon for the application and the image for
          the splash screen.

        - Maskable Icon URL (Optional): URL to an image that is at least
          512x512px to be used when generating maskable icons. Maskable
          icons should look good when their edges are removed by an icon
          mask. They will be used to display adaptive launcher icons on the
          Android home screen.

? Splash screen color: #FFFFFF
? Icon URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/manifest-icon-512.maskable.png
? Maskable icon URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/manifest-icon-512.maskable.png

Optional Features (4/5)

        - Include app shortcuts: This question is only prompted if a
          'shortcuts' section is available on the input Web Manifest. When
          answered “yes”, Bubblewrap uses the information to generate
          shortcuts on the Android app. Read more about app shortcuts at
          https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/.

        - Monochrome icon URL: URL to an image that is at least 48x48px to
          be used when generating monochrome icons. Monochrome icons should
          look good when displayed with a single color, the PWA's
          theme_color. They will be used for notification icons.

? Monochrome icon URL:
? Include support for Play Billing (this relies on alpha dependencies)? No
? Request geolocation permission? No

Signing key information (5/5)

1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

1.4 "Google" means Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


2. Accepting the License Agreement

2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


3. SDK License from Google

3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not the License Agreement.

3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized mannerthe servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time.

14. General Legal Terms

14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not betaken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement withoutaffecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.
